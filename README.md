# track-my-manhwa
Some python scripts to track manhwa that you are interested in.

## How-to
You need Python3 and the following libraries installed:
- BeautifulSoup4
- Requests

Navigate to the folder containing this script and drag & drop into cmd/Anaconda shell (if you have it).

Alternatively, run the script in Windows cmd(or any Linux shell) using the command:
`python3 your_folder_path/Track_My_Manhwa.py`

### Adding more titles for tracking
Open the script file and add the title with url to 'mangaDict' in the format -  `"title": "url"`

## Support
Currently, the script works only for translations made by groups such as LeviatanScans, ReaperScans etc.
